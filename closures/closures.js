/*
In this problem set we will review closures. Before you freak out, remember that closure is
just a function that returns another function.

Problem 1:
Write a function that accepts an exponent and returns back a function that accepts
a number and takes it to the power of the exponent.

Example:
var square = pow(2);
var cube = pow(3);

square(3);//should return 9
cube(3);//should return 27
